### Background

The purpose of phrase mining is to extract high-quality phrases from a large amount of text corpus. It identifies the phrases instead of an unigram word, which provides a much more understanding of the text.  In this study, we apply AutoPhrase method into two different datasets and compare the decreasing quality ranked list of phrase ranked list in multi-words and single word. Our datasets are from the abstract of Scientific papers in English with the English knowledge base from Wikipedia. Through this project, we will be able to understand the advantages of the AutoPhrase method and how to implement Autophrase in two datasets by identifying different outcomes it produces. 

### Purpose of the Code

For CheckPoint 2, our code would do the data ingestion proportion first, to pull DBLP.txt as the input corpus for future use from the cloud and save it at data/EN/ depository depending on the hyper-parameter. Then to perform some basic EDA on it. At the end we would run the autophrase algorithm.

### Code Content
Some Python Scripts, involved in etl.py, eda.py, to download data, process data, and analyze data.


	
### How to Run the Code

To get the data, from the project root dir, 

run python run.py data

This downloads the data from Kaggle in the directory specified in config/data-params.json.

To get the data, from the project root dir, 

run python run.py data eda

This downloads the data, then performs EDA and saves the figures in the location specified in config/eda-params.json.

To get the data, from the project root dir, 

run python run.py data eda auto

This downloads the data, then performs EDA and saves the figures in the location specified in config/eda-params.json and run autophrase algorithm from our submodule.
